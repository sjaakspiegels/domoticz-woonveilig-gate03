# Domoticz-Woonveilig-Gate03-Plugin
Domoticz Python plugin for Woonveilig GATE03

Trying to connect my Woonveilig installation with Domoticz, I found the github repo System67/GateKeeper. 

Because I had some problems reading the sensor states, I first forked this repo to make it work. But then I found out the code should be compatible with all the versions of the Woonveilig gates (version 1 to 3). I have a version 3 installation so I am not able to test the code with a version 1 or 2.

For this reason I created a new repo.

Installation:

cd domoticz/plugins

git clone https://github.com/sjaakspiegels/domoticz-woonveilig-gate03.git
